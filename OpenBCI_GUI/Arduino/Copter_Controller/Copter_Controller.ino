    CONTROL THE SWIMMING SHARK!
    
    modified from Chip Audette's code here

    This controls the SWIMMING SHARK
    http://www.amazon.com/William-Mark-AS001-Remote-Control/dp/B005FYEAJ8
    The SWIMMING SHARK controller buttons makes connection to GND when pressed. 
    I am sharing GND between the controller and Arduino. Then using pins 13, 12, 11, 10.
